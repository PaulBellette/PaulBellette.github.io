So I think we can all agree that (in Australia at least), road bicycles are a disposable middle class trinket, to be cast away like detritus as soon as a new shiny thing comes along. This makes me sad, they are so much fun, good for your health, have a lower impact on the environment than other modes of transport, can be a ludicrously cheap way to get around and they have interesting dynamics. But you know, shiny things and status symbols and all that jazz. You cannot tame the consumerist urge of your average MAMIL. Don't get me wrong, I like useless technology, I just wouldn't be caught dead paying a grand for some strain gauges that get called a Power Meter, However, I am also a lazy creature and wouldn't hack together my own power meter either. So no power meter for me, in fact no road bike for me. I have some skinny tyres on a 10 year old hardtail with mix and match wheels and brakes to get me around the city. But if you like that sort of thing, knock yourself out. Toys are fun. But then there is [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/powerpod/aeropod-power-and-aerodynamic-cda-measurement-for). Which seems like the next level. Maybe there are people out there spending money on wind tunnel time so this looks like a cheap option? Who knows, not I. But it got me thinking, surely if you already have a power meter, GNSS measurements and accelerometers like your average gear freak cyclist, I don't think a pitot tube is going to help you that much. I am going to go through the forces involved and we can see what we can do with what we have already.

## Fluid Dynamics is Really, Really Hard

I'm not going to say too much here for fear on embarrassing myself, but at high Reynolds Number the resistive force on a body in a fluid, $F_{drag}$, is reasonably approximated by the following function

$$F_{drag} = 1/2 \rho A c_{d} v^2$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $A$ is the frontal area, $c_{d}$ is the "drag coefficient" and $v$ is the free stream velocity of the fluid (the speed far enough away to be undisturbed by having the thing in the flow). Cool beans. You can imagine that there is this magic coefficient that determines your drag based on your shape, except it sort of is more like a function of speed than a coefficient ewww. But anyway, let's pretend. You can see straight away that if you want less force of drag for a fixed speed you can alter either the air density (not practical), your frontal area (very, very practical, that's what tri-bars are all about) or you can lower your drag coefficient. It is often practical to lump the drag coefficient and frontal area into a "drag area". Bicycles (and Motorbikes) are an aerodynamic nightmare, they have a terrible drag coefficient. Mostly due to the giant monkey hanging off the back of them. There has been a lot of experimentation with various fairings on motorcycles historically, dustbin fairings had a lot of success in reducing the drag coefficient but were banned due to concerns about stability due to those interesting dynamics I alluded to earlier, stability in cross-winds and lack of range of motion for the steering. So your best bet for going fast is getting a small frontal area.

## Contact Mechanics is Really, Really Hard Also

When two things touch they squish into one another to form a contact patch. If the two materials are elastic then [Hertz](https://archive.org/details/cu31924012500306) has you covered. He solved the 2D half space elastic contact problem (along with many other things). He was interested the optical problems caused when lenses were touching due to the elastic deformations in the glass. He casually opened up a whole area of applied mathematics then waltzed away to do other things for which he is more famous. Ok, that is touching solved, what happens with rolling? Say we put a force on one of the bodies in contact, what happens next? Now things get murky. If you are still in 2D (really big radius of curvature in one direction, like a steam roller), still elastic and quasi-static and low tangential force compared to the normal force pushing the bodies together, then you can jump to 1926 and the work of [Carter](http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/112/760/151) who was interested in stability problems for railway dynamics (a subject close to my heart). Break any of those assumptions and things get really messy. To go to 3D Elastic Contacts, then the most important stuff is probably the work by [Kalker](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780792307129). For including non-stationary effects, plasticity, heating, visco-elastic behaviour first consult [Johnson](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/contact-mechanics/E3707F77C2EBCE727C3911AFBD2E4AC2) and then be surprised that this is still an active area of research! So let's be properly dumb applied mathematicians (yet aware of our ignorance) and say that for our bicycle, we are going to take a Taylor series for this complicated dynamical phenomenon, just to two terms too!

$$F_{rolling} = a_{stiction} + b_{rolling}v$$

We may as well just chuck all that drive train stuff in there as well, because that is just a bunch of rolling contacts too. So we have a static force to get going and then a slowly rising force that is linear with the rolling speed. If the slip between the wheel and the ground isn't too big let's just pretend that this is the bicycle speed.

## Good Old High School Physics

What more can I say, this is the old high school physics favourite of a mass on an incline.

$$F_{fatarse} = mgsin(\theta) $$

## The Rider

The rider is putting force into the system with their legs. If we have access to a power meter we know the sort of trivial relationship that

$$ P = Fv $$

So that we can say

$$ F_{rider} = P_{rider}/v $$

## Putting it all Together

So if we what to balance all these forces we can pit the driving force against the resistive forces to yield

$$ ma = P_{rider}/v - \left(1/2 \rho A c_{d}v^2 + a_{stiction} + b_{rolling}v + mgsin(\theta)\right) $$

Cool, now we have a (crude) 1D model for the longitudinal dynamics of a bicycle. Also, we have all I think we need to estimate the drag area from time series measurements of the longitudinal acceleration $a$, the longitudinal velocity $v$, the rider power $P_{rider}$ and the inclination of the slope $\theta$. The next section will show how we can do this.
