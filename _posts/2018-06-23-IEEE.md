So, this post is supposed to function as my notes for the upcoming IEEE signal 
processing journal club presentation. I decided to pick the excellent paper by
Batson, Spielman and Srivastava on [Twice Ramanujan sparsifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0163).
I can't honestly even remember how I came across this paper, but it stuck in my mind
as a really cool result that I wanted to understand one day. This seemed like as good a time as any
to have a crack at it.

# So Why Should I Care About This?

So the dumbest and most misleading summary I can give would be that for a given undirected graph, 
there is a sparse graph that contains almost the same information. The paper gives a constructive
proof that such a sparse graph exists by giving a polynomial time complexity algorithm for finding 
this approximating graph. Neat! Only problem is that it is cubic in the number of vertices. Dang!
Although there are other algorithms that do pretty much the same thing, with either randomized 
algorithms (ref) or less strong guarantees but less time complexity (ref). So as an utterly dirty applied
mathematician I can use these and not feel too bad about it, because I know that such good approximating 
graphs actually do exist.

# A Motivating Example

I always find that a nice example from the everyday helps me understand why this results would be useful. 
So lets imagine that you had wasted the last six years of your life trying to find things with laser scans. 
A completely hypothetical situation. One of the big problems you have with measuring stuff is that absolute 
positioning is hard to get accurately (say with an RTK GNSS system, accuracy in the order of cm), whereas 
relative measurements are pretty straight forward and high accuracy (a time of flight laser pulse system, 
accuracy in the order of mm). It would be nice to be able to use all the measurements together to simultaneously 
map the world and locate yourself to get a better estimate of where everything is than from the individual 
measurements alone. 

So let's just pretend that you had a lovely pentagon that you wanted to measure, so you measured it from five positions 
around the outside with a terrestrial scanner, as represented in the following picture.

(pic here)

The set up is that the GNSS reciever on the scanner reports positions with a standard deviation of 5cm, and it measures 
the points of the pentagons with an accuracy of 5mm. Lets go crazy and say that it also measures where the 
other measurement positions are as well with the same accuracy (you left some markers on the ground that you 
can see with the scanner).
