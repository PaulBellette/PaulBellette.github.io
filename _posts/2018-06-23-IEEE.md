So, this post is supposed to function as my notes for the upcoming IEEE signal 
processing journal club presentation. I decided to pick the excellent paper by
Batson, Spielman and Srivastava on [Twice Ramanujan sparsifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0163).
I can't honestly even remember how I came across this paper, but it stuck in my mind
as a really cool result that I wanted to understand one day. This seemed like as good a time as any
to have a crack at it.
